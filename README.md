# Linear-Regression-APK
This is a simple android application that lets you calculate Linear Regression
The app directory contains the source code for the apk
If you just need the apk you can download it from the main directory

# Behind The Scenes
I used the kivy library for python 2.7 to build the application. I then used buildozer to package the code to apk.
